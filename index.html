      <h2>The Only <br><strong>ONLINE GRAPHIC DESIGN COURSE</strong><br> Youâ€™ll Need to Take!</h2>
      <div class="line-decoration"></div>
      <div class="about">
        <p>Learning graphic design on your own can be crazy overwhelming. Where do I start? What program do I use? How do I make sure my graphics donâ€™t look cheap and DIYâ€™d?
        <br><br>
        (For real, WHY are there so many buttons, tools and control panels?!)
        <br><br>
        Online graphic design courses can be scary, too, because how do you really know what youâ€™re getting?
        <br><br>
        If youâ€™ve ever felt like this, Iâ€™ve got just what youâ€™re looking for â€“ (and past students to prove it)!
        <br><br>
        Be Your Own Designer is a step-by-step course teaching you the basic skills and tools you need to know to design graphics for your blog, business, or future clients within my favorite design program, Adobe Illustrator.
        I use Adobe Illustrator to design literally everything for both mine and my clientsâ€™ businesses.
        <br><br>
        It can be used to design everything from print products like business cards and brochures to web graphics like social media templates and banners. It's also the one program you should always use to design a logo.
        <br><br>
        But just like any Adobe program, Illustrator does have an overwhelming amount of tools. But donâ€™t worry because Iâ€™m here to cut the overwhelm! Just think of me as a graphic design superhero, here to save you from your own frustration. ðŸ˜‰
        <br><br>
        Iâ€™ve compiled a list of the tools and functions I use the most and will teach you how to use them too â€” holding your hand the whole way, of course!
        </p>

<!-- this is the module description section -->
    <div class="modules">
      <div class="modules-intro">
      <p>Each week after youâ€™ve mastered a new set of tools, weâ€™ll put your new design skills to use to create a new graphic for your business. Double score â€” new skills and new graphics all at once?! Sign me up.
      <br><br>
      Be Your Own Designer is essentially a spark notes version of a semester at design school (with WAY less stress and WAY less tuition â€“ although feel free to eat plenty of Ramen while we work to feel like youâ€™re getting the full college experience).
      <br><br>
      The course is separated into four different modules which will be released weekly so you can easily digest the new information a little bit at a time.

      <h2>For those of you who donâ€™t know me, Iâ€™m Mariah and Illustrator is my JAM.</h2>
      <div class="line-decoration"></div>
      <p>Iâ€™ve used it probably every day for the last seven years â€“ in fact, I probably spend more time with it than my boyfriend. Iâ€™m a graphic designer and branding extraordinaire and although I work with some huge companies <em>(by huge I mean Walmart)</em>, my real passion is working with small business owners, entrepreneurs, and bloggers. As a small business owner myself, I totally understand the need for being low budget and DIYing everything possible, especially when you're first starting out. I also totally understand wanting to learn new skills for yourself.
      <br><br>
      Although I went to school for graphic design, I also was thrown into a leadership role at a design firm almost immediately after college and had to learn a TON of things on my own. <em>(Seriously, a degree is not nearly as practical as one would think it is. Go figure).</em>
      <br><br>
      But it was from that experience that Be Your Own Designer became an idea. I realized I wanted to teach others what you actually needed to know in order to become a graphic designer. No need for the overwhelm or trying to piece together internet tutorials like I did. <strong>Instead, I want to go straight to the tools, skills, and functions you actually need to know in order to be successful and cut the rest of the BS out of the curriculum.</strong>
      <br><br>
      <strong>Essentially Iâ€™m taking my overpriced $80k degree in graphic design and giving you the cliff notes version of what you actually need to know to design like a pro.</strong>
